# LL Unibot77
Project of Laurel Biolley and Lukas Hecht

This project was created during the Impuls Workshop III, BA Visual Communication and Digital Spaces, at HGK Basel FHNW.

LL Unibot77 explores typography (Specimen of Lineto Typefaces) and the interaction between two robots. On two different levels, an atmosphere is created simultaneously, one that originates from cross-media experimentation. The visual reveals how data responds to movement and transforms over time. We analyse the topic, type and form, and question whether machines function solely as products of an endless system or if they hold the agency to reshape it.

Creative Direction: Studio Unstated
Typography: Lineto
